The coffee was lukewarm and the baklava, while tasty, was a measly two bites for 8 euros. The service was as warm as the coffee, with a grumpy waitress who seemed annoyed by our presence.  I'd recommend skipping this place and finding a more authentic, less expensive option.  Athens has so much to offer, and this restaurant wasn't it. \\n\\n    \\n    ***OUTPUT JSON***\\n    {\\n       \\\"cuisine\\\": __, \\n       \\\"rating\\\": __, \\n       \\\"summary\\\": __\\n    }\"}\n"
